        <h1>What ARIA <em>doesn't</em> do</h1>
        <p data-reveal="1">
            It's important to note that the <strong>only</strong> thing affected by ARIA is the accessibility tree.
            And this in turn has no relevance except to assistive technologies like screenreaders.
        </p>
        <p data-reveal="2">
            And, as we all know, there is much more to accessibility than just screenreaders.
        </p>
        <p data-reveal="3">
            So it is not true that "ARIA makes pages accessible" - or at least, not as simple as that!
        </p>
        <h2 data-reveal="4">An example</h2>
        <div data-reveal="5">
            <code>&lt;div role="button"&gt;hey I'm a button&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            will be considered to be a button as far as screenreaders are concerned:
        </div>
        <ul data-reveal="6">
            <li data-reveal="6">it will be announced as a button</li>
            <li data-reveal="7">it will appear in a list of buttons on the page</li>
            <li data-reveal="8">users will be given a way to trigger a click action on it</li>
        </ul>
        <div data-reveal="9">
            <span>but...</span>
            <ul data-reveal="10">
                <li data-reveal="10">this "button" won't be keyboard-focusable (in the tab order)</li>
                <li data-reveal="11">
                    even if you make it so (with <code>tabindex="0"</code>), that focus won't be
                    automatically visible
                </li>
                <li data-reveal="12">
                    it won't allow keyboard activation (with space or enter key) like a native button does
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p data-reveal="13">
            You could do all this yourself (with CSS and Javascript) - but a native HTML <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>
            would give you all of this for free, as well as working the same with screenreaders!
        </p>
        <p data-reveal="14">
            Similarly, something like <code>&lt;span role="checkbox" aria-label="I'm a checkbox"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> might
            make an assistive technology treat it as a checkbox - but without considerable extra effort it will neither
            look like a checkbox to sighted users nor do anything at all when clicked/activated!
        </p>
        <p data-reveal="15">
            These examples are not particularly realistic (breaking the "first rule of ARIA" - see later!), but they make an
            important point that's relevant also to more appropriate uses of ARIA:
        </p>
        <p data-reveal="16">
            ARIA only deals with <em>semantics</em> - what an element means. It's also static, like all HTML - it can only
            provide the state of a UI element at any one time. And it doesn't do anything at all for keyboard accessibility.
        </p>
        <p data-reveal="17">
            All that has to be provided separately via Javascript.
