        <p data-reveal="1">
            A web page, at root, consists of HTML markup.
            This is converted by the browser to the content and behaviour that the user sees.
        </p>
        <p data-reveal="2">
            (The behaviour typically comes from Javascript - which can alter the HTML "on the fly" to produce new/different content.)
        </p>
        <p data-reveal="3">
            Assistive technologies - such as screenreaders - "see" the same HTML markup, NOT the visual output in the browser.
            They need to be able to make sense of this to announce to their users - who typically will not be able to see the visual output - the relevant parts of what is there.
