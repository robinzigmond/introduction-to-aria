        <h1>The accessibility tree</h1>
        <a href="https://benmyers.dev/blog/accessibility-tree/">
            See this blog post by Ben Myers for a great in-depth explanation of this topic.

        <p data-reveal="1">
            Rather than an assistive technologies directly "reading" the HTML markup, and interpreting them
            in their own way, the markup is first converted by the browser into an "accessibility tree".
        </p>
        <p data-reveal="2">Why is this a good idea?</p>
        <ul data-reveal="3">
            <li data-reveal="3">
                it provides a "common language" for all assistive technologies to use
            </li>
            <li data-reveal="4">
                assistive technologies are needed by their users to interpret everything on a computer/phone/tablet/etc,
                not just webpages! Operating systems provide Accessibility Trees for native features which assistive
                technologies already need to use - by reducing a webpage to an Accessibility Tree they need do nothing
                special for web pages
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p data-reveal="5">
            Note the different responsibilities here:
            <ul data-reveal="6">
                <li data-reveal="6">
                    Converting the HTML/DOM into an Accessibility Tree is done by the browser
                </li>
                <li data-reveal="7">
                    Interpreting the Accessibility Tree into user-facing behaviour is done by the assistive technology.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p data-reveal="8">
            This explains why using different screenreaders on the same browser, and the same screenreader on different
            browsers, sometimes behave differently in the same situations.
        </p>
        <p data-reveal="9">Modern browser versions let you inspect the accessibility tree directly!</p>
